# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

Author: Dimuthu Attanayake

The objective of the assignment is to collect and clean a wearable computing data set collected from the accelerometers from the
Samsung Galaxy S smartphone to create a R script. The link to the dataset is given below.

## Files in this repository
 1) run_analysis.R which is a R script that produces a tidy data set by:
 
 *Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 *Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
 *Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 *Appropriately labelling the data set with descriptive variable names.
 *From the data set in step 4, creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
 
 2)CODEBOOK.md a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations I have performed to clean up the data and 
 to create the tidy data set
 
 3)FinalData.txt the tidy data set obtained by running run_analysis.R
 
 4) README.md
